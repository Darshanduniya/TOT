1. LEAP-8644 – Build Generic DAG for Merging Multiple Industries
Initially, we had hardcoded scripts and created an ad-hoc DAG to execute TEC_TOT, which is a combination of TEC_CET and TEC_TOT.

This week, I developed a generic script and a generic DAG to handle this in a scalable manner.

Successfully tested the end-to-end pipeline on the stage side within the Dev Airflow environment.

2. LEAP-6550 – Create Dynamic fact_time_mapping
Problem: Manual creation was required whenever a new industry was onboarded or an existing one had a calendar_id change.

Solution: Integrated Aldrich inputs with Oracle DB to dynamically fetch calendar_id and generate fact_time_mapping.

This component is now reusable across all dependent modules.

Successfully tested for one industry in Dev Airflow; pending multi-industry validation before Prod deployment.

3. LEAP-6550 – Create Separate DAG Flow for Ad-hoc Job Fetching
Worked on separating the DAG structure for ad-hoc job execution flows.

These are part of this week's development activities and are in progress.
